# Ultimate Battleships


Ultimate Battleships is a python game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try and sink all of the computer's ships before the computer sinks all of their ships. Each battleship occupies one square on the board. Users try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.

## How to play
----

Ultimate Battleships is based on the classic pen-and-paper game. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

In this version, the player enters their name and the desired amount of ships then two boards are randomly generated.

The player can see where their ships are, indicated by an `@` sign, but cannot see where the computer's ships are.

If guesses miss, they are marked on the board with an `X`.

If guesses hit, they are indicated by `*`.

The player and the computer then take it in turns to make guesses and try to sink each other's battleships.

The winner is the player who sinks all of their opponent's ships first.
