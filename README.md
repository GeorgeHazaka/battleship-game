# Ultimate Battleships


Ultimate Battleships is a python game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try and sink all of the computer's ships before the computer sinks all of their ships. Each battleship occupies one square on the board. Users try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.
